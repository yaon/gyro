Introduction
---

This is the project of 3 EPITA's students consisting in building a
self-balancing gyropod from scratch.

The different materials we chose to use are the following:
  - MD25 MotorDrive
  - 2 Intel Galileo boards:
    - One used to send command directly to the MD25
    - A main one to send higher level commands and allow wifi interface
  - Wifi card
  - Wifi cable
  - MMA8452 accelerometer

How to get the image and the working environment
---

We followed that tutorial in order to build the yocto image used on the boards:
  https://communities.intel.com/servlet/JiveServlet/previewBody/21882-102-1-25153/Quark_BSPBuildGuide_329687_001.pdf
Using the tutorial we also built the full image onto our desktop computer to
allow cross-compilation. Since the boards aren't very powerful, it is better to
cross-compile and then deploy the created binary on the board.

How to use the project
---

The first thing to do before compiling anything is to source the configuration
file created by the build:
  source /opt/clanton-tiny/1.4.2/environment-setup-i586-poky-linux-uclibc
This will initialize all the environment variables in order to allow cmake to
automatically search the different compilation tools at the right path.

The images used on the SD card are configured to have a static IP address at
boot which is 192.168.112.112. In order to communicate using ssh with the board
you need to have an IP set under the same subnetwork(i.e. 192.168.112.X).

The configure file will create the Makefile in order to compile. All the
generated files are place in the build folder.

The different make rules are the following:
  all       - compile the project
  clean     - remove the generated object files
  deploy    - compile and copy the binary onto the board at ~/gyro
  run       - deploy and directly run the binary
  distclean - remove every generated file, Makefile included
  dist      - zip the files in source.zip
